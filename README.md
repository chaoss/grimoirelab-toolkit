# GrimoireLab Toolkit [![Build Status](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit/workflows/tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit/actions?query=workflow:tests+branch:main+event:push) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit?branch=main)

Toolkit of common functions used across GrimoireLab projects.

This package provides a library composed by functions widely used in other
GrimoireLab projects. These function deal with date handling, introspection,
URIs/URLs, among other topics.

## Requirements

 * Python >= 3.8

You will also need some other libraries for running the tool, you can find the
whole list of dependencies in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file.

## Installation

There are several ways to install GrimoireLab Toolkit on your system: packages or source 
code using Poetry or pip.

### PyPI

GrimoireLab Toolkit can be installed using pip, a tool for installing Python packages. 
To do it, run the next command:
```
$ pip install grimoirelab-toolkit
```

### Source code

To install from the source code you will need to clone the repository first:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit
$ cd grimoirelab-toolkit
```

Then use pip or Poetry to install the package along with its dependencies.

#### Pip
To install the package from local directory run the following command:
```
$ pip install .
```
In case you are a developer, you should install GrimoireLab Toolkit in editable mode:
```
$ pip install -e .
```

#### Poetry
We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and 
packaging. You can install it following its [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
Once you have installed it, you can install GrimoireLab Toolkit and the dependencies in 
a project isolated environment using:
```
$ poetry install
```
To spaw a new shell within the virtual environment use:
```
$ poetry shell
```

## Credential Manager Library

This is a module made to retrieve credentials from different secrets management systems like Bitwarden.
It accesses the secrets management service, looks for the desired credential and returns it in String form.

To use the module in your python code

### Bitwarden

```
from grimoirelab_toolkit.credential_manager import BitwardenManager


# Instantiate the Bitwarden manager using the api credentials for login
bw_manager = BitwardenManager("your_client_id", "your_client_secret", "your_master_password")

# Login
bw_manager.login()

# Retrieve a secret from Bitwarden
username = bw_manager.get_secret("github")
password = bw_manager.get_secret("elasticsearch")

# Logout
bw_manager.logout()
```


#### Response format

When calling `get_secret(item_name)`, the method returns a JSON object with the following structure:

_NOTE: the parameter "item_name" corresponds with the field "name" of the json. That's the name of the item._
(in this case, GitHub)


##### Example Response
